Hello everyone! My name is Rebekah Bryer (but you can call me Beka) and I am a first year MA student in Public History. I grew up in Maine and did my undergraduate work at Wheaton College (MA) where I study theatre and history, focusing on theatre in the early United States. Since then, Iâ€™ve been working in the theatre but am excited to be studying history again. My interests in Public History are in living history and the National Park Service.
